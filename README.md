Collection of my implementations of STL containers and other functions

## TODO
Make list of stl containers and functions I want to replicate, or new ones to create (ex concurrent_hashmap).


### Current List (Tick means in progress/finished)
- [X] Vector (SBO)
- [ ] String (SSO)
- [ ] Unique Ptr + Make Unique
- [ ] unordered + ordered map
- [ ] Dequeue
- [ ] Array
- [ ] Pair
- [ ] Tuple
- [ ] List
- [ ] Concurrent Hashmap

## vector
Added initial implementation of vector, still needs full allocator functionality, use of uniqu ptrs(self created), initializer list, exception safe, thread safety (maybe...).
